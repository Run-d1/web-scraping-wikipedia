# web-scraping-wikipedia Project: Largest US Companies by Revenue

This project is my first web-scraping program, completed as part of the 'Data Analyst Bootcamp' by Alex The Analyst on YouTube. The goal of this project is to scrape structured data from a Wikipedia page and make it accessible for analysis.

## About the Project

The program uses Python and the Beautiful Soup library to scrape data from the Wikipedia page:
[Wikipedia: List of largest companies in the United States by revenue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_largest_companies_in_the_United_States_by_revenue)

### Features
- Extracts company names, revenue, and other relevant details.
- Saves the scraped data into a structured format (CSV).

### Purpose
- Practice web-scraping techniques.
- Gain familiarity with handling HTML and parsing data.
- Demonstrate a basic understanding of Python programming and libraries.
