# web-scraping-wikipedia
This project is a beginner-friendly Python script for web scraping, created during my learning journey in the 'Data Analyst Bootcamp' by Alex The Analyst on YouTube. It scrapes the Wikipedia page listing the largest companies in the United States by revenue and organizes the data into a structured format for analysis.
